Since the tml 1.4.4 update the localization system, create this to storage the zh-Hans files.
put the zh-Hans in your mod localization file with en-US, then rebuild it, if all goes fine then the mod itself will have localization display based on what language tmod using.

仅用来存储Tml版本1.4.4上的辅助类模组的汉化文件
