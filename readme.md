## About The Project

* Since the tml 1.4.4 update the localization system, create this to storage the zh-Hans files.

* put the zh-Hans.hjson in yourmodname/localization file, there should already be en-US.hjson file in it,
then rebuild the mod, if all goes well then the mod itself will have localization display based on what language tmod using.

* 仅用来存储Tml版本1.4.4上的辅助类模组的汉化文件
