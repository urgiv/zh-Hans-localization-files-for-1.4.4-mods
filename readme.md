## About The Project

Since the TML 1.4.4 update the localization system, create this to storage the zh-Hans.hjson and Simplified Chinese of mod's Title & Descriptionfiles in workshop.

* put the zh-Hans.hjson in yourmodname/localization file, there should already be en-US.hjson file in it,
then rebuild the mod, if all goes well then the mod itself will have localization display based on what language tmod using.
* [Guide page for TML 1.4.4 localization](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Localization) 
* Creator of the mod could edit mod's Title & Descriptionfiles in workshop, and choose what to display for each language.
* Just pin me or report Issues when new Items/Features are added in your mod, I'll update the workshop texts.

* 仅用来存储Tml版本1.4.4上未公开代码的辅助类模组的汉化zh-Hans文件，和已汉化模组创意工坊的中文版标题&描述。
