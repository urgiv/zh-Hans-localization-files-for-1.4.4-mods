Title:
ARSENAL - Weapons expansion mod

Description:
[h1]ARSENAL: Weapons Expansion Mod[/h1]

Arsenal is a mod made to compliment the vanilla weapons selection by expanding many of the weapon subcategories throughout the different stages of the game.
This mod currently boasts nearly 300 new items, which is almost entirely weapons. Does this cause potential for content bloat? Sure, but it also gives you tons of options (Almost ~75% more!) to choose from across all stages of vanilla progression and makes it more than likely you can stick to a certain subclass of weapon (e.g. shortswords) the entire time!

[b]NOTICE: This mod is in an open beta state! About 75% of planned content currently exsists, though a sizeable amount is subject to refurbishing as various weapons no longer meet my standards of quality (visually and/or mechanically), which is intended to reflect those set by vanilla 1.4.4+ gen content. Also beware that there are multiple known issues within the current build, including some multiplayer-exclusive issues (Though multiplayer is still playable). Most, if not all known issues are listed in the FAQ thread on this workshop.[/b]
