Drill  Expansion

Description:
Drill Expansion:
Drill expansion introduces new drill counterparts to most vanilla Terraria pickaxes, amplifying your mining experience at every game stage.

Buffs:
- Increases all vanilla drills from the default 60% speed bonus to an extra 33% to make them viable throughout the game.
- All modded drills have the same 60% speed bonus and the 33%, making pre-hardmode drills just as good.
- The zenith drill has 250% pickaxe power and is able to mine up to auric ore in calamity mod.

For mod suggestions or issues, please comment.
