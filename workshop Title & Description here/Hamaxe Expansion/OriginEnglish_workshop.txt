Hamaxe Expansion

Description:
Hamaxe Expansion:
Hamaxe expansion brings in new hamaxes for every stage of the game. I made this mod because I usually play with a ton of QOL mods and use loads of different weapons. It's just super handy to have an axe and hammer combined, you know? Saves that precious hotbar space.

For mod suggestions or issues, please comment.
