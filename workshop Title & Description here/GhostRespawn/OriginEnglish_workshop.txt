Title:
Ghost Respawn

Description:
Causes you to become a ghost when you die, allowing you to move around while waiting to respawn.
Additionally in multiplayer, if you are within a certain distance of the closest living player (60 blocks or 120ft by default) you will respawn at the same position rather than at your spawn point.

There is also a config to change:
-if you can respawn during boss fights,
-if the closest player must be on your team,
-if you always respawn at your spawnpoint,
-the distance required to the closest player,
-the respawn timer when bosses are not alive (set to -1 to disable override),
-the respawn timer when bosses are alive (set to -1 to disable override).

For more control over the respawn timer use JavidPack's 'Shorter Respawn Time' mod:
