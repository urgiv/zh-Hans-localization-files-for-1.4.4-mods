!! If you experience any bugs or have any suggestions to improve the mod, please feel free to leave a comment !!

Mod compatability notes:
> Internal name is "LureBaitDisplay"
> If you use any calls, make sure to add a weak reference to at least the version number when the call was added
> Use Mod.Call("HideBaitType", int itemType) in your mod's PostSetupContent() to hide specific bait items from being drawn on the hook
> Use Mod.Call("IgnoreLureType", int projectileType) in your mod's PostSetupContent() to ignore specific lures (All mod functionality will be skipped for the set types, even hiding lures)
